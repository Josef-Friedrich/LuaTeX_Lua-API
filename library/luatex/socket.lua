---To obtain the `socket` namespace, run:

---```lua
----- loads the socket module
---local socket = require("socket")

---Creates and returns a clean

---
---Note: This idea saved a lotof work with the

---
---```lua
---foo = socket.protect(function()
---    -- connect somewhere
---    local c = socket.try(socket.connect("somewhere", 42))
---    -- create a try function that closes 'c' on error

---
---Converts a function that throws exceptions into a safe function. This
---function only catches exceptions thrown by the `try`
---and `newtry`functions. It does not catch normal
---Lua errors.
---
---@param func function # `func` is a function that calls `try` (or `assert`, or `error`) to throw exceptions.

function socket.protect(func) end

---
---Waits for a number of sockets to change status.
---
--- `Recvt` and `sendt` can also
---be empty tables or `nil`. Non-socket values (or values with
---non-numeric indices) in the arrays will be silently ignored.
---
---The function returns a list with the sockets ready for
---reading, a list with the sockets ready for writing and an error message.
---The error message is "`timeout`" if a timeout
---condition was met, "`select failed`" if the call
---to `select` failed, and
---`nil` otherwise. The returned tables are
---doubly keyed both by integers and also by the sockets
---themselves, to simplify the test if a specific socket has
---changed status.
---
---Note:`select` can monitor a limited number
---of sockets, as defined by the constant
---`socket._SETSIZE`. This
---number may be as high as 1024 or as low as 64 by default,
---depending on the system. It is usually possible to change this
---at compile time. Invoking `select` with a larger
---number of sockets will raise an error.
---
---Important note: a known bug in WinSock causes `select` to fail
---on non-blocking TCP sockets. The function may return a socket as
---writable even though the socket is notready for sending.
---
---Another important note: calling select with a server socket in the receive parameter before a call to accept does notguarantee
---`accept`will return immediately.
---Use the `settimeout`
---method or `accept` might block forever.
---
---Yet another note: If you close a socket and pass
---it to `select`, it will be ignored.
---
---Using select with non-socket objects: Any object that implements `getfd` and `dirty` can be used with `select`, allowing objects from other libraries to be used within a `socket.select` driven loop.
---
---@param recvt table|nil # `recvt` is an array with the sockets to test for characters available for reading.
---@param sendt table|nil # Sockets in the `sendt` array are watched to see if it is OK to immediately write on them.
---@param timeout? integer # `timeout` is the
---maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a change in status.  A
---`nil`, negative or omitted `timeout` value allows the
---function to block indefinitely.
