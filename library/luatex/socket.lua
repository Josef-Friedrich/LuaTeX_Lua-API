---Waits for a number of sockets to change status.
---
--- `Recvt` and `sendt` can also
---be empty tables or `nil`. Non-socket values (or values with
---non-numeric indices) in the arrays will be silently ignored.
---
---The function returns a list with the sockets ready for
---reading, a list with the sockets ready for writing and an error message.
---The error message is "`timeout`" if a timeout
---condition was met, "`select failed`" if the call
---to `select` failed, and
---`nil` otherwise. The returned tables are
---doubly keyed both by integers and also by the sockets
---themselves, to simplify the test if a specific socket has
---changed status.
---
---Note:`select` can monitor a limited number
---of sockets, as defined by the constant
---`socket._SETSIZE`. This
---number may be as high as 1024 or as low as 64 by default,
---depending on the system. It is usually possible to change this
---at compile time. Invoking `select` with a larger
---number of sockets will raise an error.
---
---Important note: a known bug in WinSock causes `select` to fail
---on non-blocking TCP sockets. The function may return a socket as
---writable even though the socket is notready for sending.
---
---Another important note: calling select with a server socket in the receive parameter before a call to accept does notguarantee
---`accept`will return immediately.
---Use the `settimeout`
---method or `accept` might block forever.
---
---Yet another note: If you close a socket and pass
---it to `select`, it will be ignored.
---
---Using select with non-socket objects: Any object that implements `getfd` and `dirty` can be used with `select`, allowing objects from other libraries to be used within a `socket.select` driven loop.
---
---@param recvt table|nil # `recvt` is an array with the sockets to test for characters available for reading.

---
---Binds a master object to address and port on the local host.

---
---Note: The function `socket.connect` is available and is a shortcut for the creation of client sockets.
---Note: Starting with LuaSocket 2.0, the `settimeout` method affects the behavior of connect, causing it to return with an error in case of a timeout. If that happens, you can still call socket.select with the socket in the sendt table. The socket will be writable when the connection is established.
---Note: Starting with LuaSocket 3.0, the host name resolution depends on whether the socket was created by socket.tcp, socket.tcp4 or socket.tcp6. Addresses from the appropriate family (or both) are tried in the order returned by the resolver until the first success or until the last failure. If the timeout was set to zero, only the first address is tried.

---@alias TCPTimeoutMode
---| "b" block timeout. Specifies the upper limit on the amount of time LuaSocket can be blocked by the operating system while waiting for completion of any single I/O operation.
---| "t" total timeout. Specifies the upper limit on the amount of time LuaSocket can block a Lua script before returning from a call.

---
---Changes the timeout values for the object. By default, all I/O operations are blocking. That is, any call to the methods `send`, `receive`, and `accept` will block indefinitely, until the operation completes. The `settimeout` method defines a limit on the amount of time the I/O methods can block. When a timeout is set and the specified amount of time has elapsed, the affected methods give up and fail with an error code.
---
---**Note:** although timeout values have millisecond precision in LuaSocket, large blocks can cause I/O functions not to respect timeout values due to the time the library takes to transfer blocks to and from the OS and to and from the Lua interpreter. Also, function that accept host names and perform automatic name resolution might be blocked by the resolver for longer than the specified timeout value.

---### To mark a socket as connected or unconnected use `---@cast`. Example:
---```lua
---local server, err = socket.udp6()
---local client, err = socket.udp6()
------@cast server UDPSocketUnconnected
---server:setsockname("127.0.0.1", 12345)
------@cast client UDPSocketConnected
---client:setpeername("127.0.0.1", 12345)
---```
---
---@return (UDPSocketConnected | UDPSocketUnconnected)?, SocketReturnError
