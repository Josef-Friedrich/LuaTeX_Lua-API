---`slnunicode`, from the `selene` libraries, http://luaforge.net/projects/sln. This library has been slightly extended
---so that the `unicode.utf8.*` functions also accept the first 256 values
---of plane 18. This is the range *LuaTeX* uses for raw binary output, as
---explained above. We have no plans to provide more like this because you can
---basically do all that you want in *Lua*.

unicode = {}

unicode.ascii = {}
unicode.grapheme = {}
unicode.latin1 = {}
unicode.utf8 = {}
